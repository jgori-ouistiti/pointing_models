Dear Dr. Pourang Irani,

\vspace{2\baselineskip}

Thank you for the detailed reviews.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

I agree with many points raised in the reviews, in particular that the structure of the paper needed to be reworked so as to make the research contributions more apparent.
I have edited many parts of the manuscript, in particular the first sections that introduce and motivate the problem, as well as the discussion section. I have also removed content that was secondary, and moved yet other content to the supplementary materials. For clarity, I have attached a document where I respond item by item to all of the remarks raised, as well as a document that tracks all changes.

I hope you will find that I have addressed most of the reviewers concerns, and that the goal and contributions of the paper are now clear.

Sincerely,\\
Julien Gori
